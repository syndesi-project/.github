# Project Description: Syndesi

Syndesi is a pioneering project aimed at streamlining communication and control of hardware devices through a comprehensive software solution. Our endeavor unfolds in two distinctive phases, designed to revolutionize the accessibility and versatility of interfacing with electronic instruments.

## Phase One: Syndesi Library
At its core, Syndesi introduces a robust software library, initially tailored for Python with a strategic roadmap to expand its compatibility across various programming languages. This foundational library empowers users to seamlessly interact with an extensive array of hardware devices, spanning from laboratory instruments, industrial interfaces and devices with common communication interfaces.

Syndesi Library Architecture:

  - Syndesi Core: The backbone of our solution, facilitating efficient communication between software and hardware.
  - Syndesi-Drivers: A complementary component dedicated to crafting device-specific abstractions, simplifying the process of controlling diverse instruments.

## Phase Two: Syndesi Hardware Development
Pending successful validation of the Syndesi Library, we embark on the second phase, entailing the creation of electronic cards engineered to function as controllable "devices" within the Syndesi ecosystem. These cards transcend traditional limitations, offering a gamut of functionalities ranging simple I/O, relays, stepper drivers to fully integrated specialized controllers. The versatility of Syndesi hardware cards opens up a realm of possibilities, allowing for tailored solutions across various industries and applications.

Syndesi represents a paradigm shift in the landscape of hardware interfacing, promising unparalleled ease of use, compatibility, and scalability. Join us as we redefine the boundaries of technological integration and empower innovation on a global scale.
